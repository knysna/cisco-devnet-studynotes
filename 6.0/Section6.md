# 6.0 Network Fundamentals
As mentioned in the intro, there are 2 target audiences for the DevNEt Assocaite Certification: Programmers learning networking and Network engineers learning programming.    
Since I am in the 2nd group I won't be spending time drawing up notes for this section as it is really basic stuff.    
If anyone is reading this and would like to contribute content for this section, please contact me/raise issue and we can arrange a pull request.
