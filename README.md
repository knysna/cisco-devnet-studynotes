# cisco-devnet-studynotes
My notes taken in preparation of Cisco DevNet Fundamentals exam 2021.    
They are revision notes, keywords, etc. Not detailed study materials.    

Two ways to approach Cisco DevNet training: a) A network engineer who needs to learn programming concepts, b) a programmer who needs to learn networking concepts.  
The approach you need to take will determine which Exam Topics you need to focus on. I am a network engineer so my revision notes will spend a lot of time on basic programming topics, but almost no time on basic networking topics.
