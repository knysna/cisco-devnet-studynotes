### ACI
https://developer.cisco.com/site/aci/    
#### About ACI
* The Nexus 9000 has two modes of operation to fit different operational models: NX-OS mode and Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode.
* ACI Mode uses a cluster of 3 controllers (APICs)
    * Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers
* ACI Mode provides spine/leaf architecture 
    * APICs connect to leaf switches
* ACI Mode switches are **only** programmable via the policy engine on the APIC.
    * Configuration is held as XML or JSON on the controller
    * Each switch also holds a copy of the Concrete model
    * "Desired state network" aka "Model driven framework"
* ACI Tenants
    * separate network/failure domains
    * divided into Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy
    * Tenant Networking
        * L2 and L3 connectivity, VRFs, bridge domains, subnets, etc.
    * Tenant Policy
        * Application profiles, end point groups, contracts, filters
        * Examples: Allow webservers in EPG (end point group) Delta to connect to SQL DB servers and apply specific QoS

#### MIM Managemnent Information Model
* MIM is represented in a tree, the MIT
* Nodes in the tree are any physical or logical Management Object, the MO
* MOs use Distinguished Name naming convention 
* Tenants are top-level MOs
#### RESt Interface
* Northbound: REST API, CLI and GUI for operators and developers
* Southbound: OpFlex protocol for managing the Nexus switches
* APIC is designed from day one around APIs
* https://APIC_Host:port/api/{mo|class}/{dn|clas
sname}.{xml|json}?\[options]
    * Content-Type headers are ignored
* Authentication is done via the generic endpoint above, against the aaaLogin.js which returns a Token
    * Token is then supplied in subsequent requests as a cookie (APIC-cookie)
#### APIC SDKs
* Python SDK: **Cobra**
* Python library: **acitoolkit**/ **pyaci**
* Ruby: **ACIrb**
* Puppet and Ansible extensively supported

    * Search for events across the org
    * List policies
    *List vulnerabilites
* API authentication
    * API credentials are configured in web console
    * Console returns a username and password in form of ClientID and ClientKey
    * Option 1: ID and Key are prepended to the requests
        * e.g. https://clientID:clientKey@api.amp.cisco.com/..../endpoint
    * Option 2: ID and Key are Base64 encoded for use in HTTP basic Auth header
        * e.g. 'Authorization' : 'Basic TheLongBase64EncodedString'


### ISE (Identitity Services Engine/NAC)
* https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/3.0/
* 2 APIs: Monitoring and External
#### Monitoring API
* REST API
    * XML output
    * XML schema is obtained from the Version API endpoint
* Example endpoint: https://<ISEhost>/admin/API/mnt/Session/MACAddress/<macaddress>
* Categories
    * Session and node data
    * CoA
    * Troubleshooting
* Monitoring API Authentication
    * User must be a member of Super Admin, System Admin, MnT Admin
    * Restricted Monitoring 'persona' - can not be used to access e.g. Policy information
#### External API
* External RESTful Services (ERS) APIs
* REST API on HTTPS, port 9060
* ERS allows external clients to perform CRUD on Cisco ISE resources.
    * e.g. Integration with external visitor management system
* External API Authentication
    * HTTP Basic authentication in request header
    * User must be a member of 'ERS Admin', 'ERS Operator'
* Must enable ERS in the ISE admin console, to open port 9060


### Threatgrid (Malware analysis)
* Now rebranded as SecureX
* https://developer.cisco.com/threat-grid/
* Cloud-based or on-prem
* API used for
    * upload files for analysis aka Submitting Samples
    * querying the database
    * deliver threat intelligence aka Curate Feeds, hourly or daily
* API authentication
    * API key
    * To receive an API key go to the Threat Grid dashboard and click your username in the top right corner. Then click My Account and then Generate API Key.
* API URL is https://panacea.threatgrid.com
* Example Request and Response for submitting a sample
```
POST /api/v2/samples?api_key=12345abcde HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

## 3.6 Describe the device level APIs and dynamic interfaces for IOS XE and NX-OS
* Slightly misleading title, this seciton is really about: YANG models, NETCONF, RESTCONF, gRPC
### Model Driven Programmability
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3535
* RFC3535 = the search for a better data model (SNMP developed in 1980s)
* Which resulted in
    * NETCONF, RFC4741, 2006
    * YANG, RFC 6020, 2010
    * RESTCONF, RFC8040, 2017
    * gRPC (Google, no RFC)
* YANG is the data model
* NETCONF, RESTCONF, gRPC are the *transport protocols*
* Can be used for Northbound or Southbound APIs
#### NETCONF
* Server = "NETCONF Agent"
* Client = "NETCONF Manager"
* Can be used for YANG or non-YANG data
* Typically uses XML format
* Uses **SSH** on **port 830** as underlying communication
#### RESTCONF
* XML or JSON format
* Uses **HTTPS** on **port 443** as underlying transport
#### YANG
* Specifically designed for describing network data models
* Very structured
* Highly typed
* Modules, Containers, Lists, Leafs
* Models created by network vendors or informal groups
* Python Library: pyang
* Example IETF standard model: *ietf-interfaces.yang*

### IOS XE
* https://developer.cisco.com/site/ios-xe/
* NETCONF runs on port 830
* Enable NETCONF with command "netconf-yang"
* Enable RESTOCNF with commands "ip http secure-server" + "restconf"
* NETCONF and RESTCONF connections should be authentication by RADIUS or TACACS+
    * RADIUS VSA "shell:priv-lvl=15"
* Applications can stream data using NETCONF+YANG subscriptions
    * Periodic subscription = sent on configured interval
    * On-change subscription = sent on specific event e.g. interface down
    * Configured by using establish-connection RPC
    * Receivers can be any collector supporting IETF Pub/Sub
* On-box Python
    * iox
    * Guestshell enable (CentOS7)
* Off-box Python
    * NCCLient (NETCONF library)
    * YANG Developer Kit (YDK-py) - contains native Python bindings
```

### NX-OS
* https://developer.cisco.com/site/nx-os/
## 3.7 Identify the appropriate DevNet resource for a given scenario (Sandbox, Code Exchange, support, forums, Learning Labs, and API documentation)
## 3.8 Apply concepts of model driven programmability (YANG, RESTCONF, and NETCONF) in a Cisco environment
## 3.9 Construct code to perform a specific operation based on a set of requirements and given API reference documentation such as these:
### 3.9.a Obtain a list of network devices by using Meraki, Cisco DNA Center, ACI, Cisco SD-WAN, or NSO
### 3.9.b Manage spaces, participants, and messages in Webex Teams
### 3.9.c Obtain a list of clients / hosts seen on a network using Meraki or Cisco DNA Center
