# 3.0 Cisco Platforms and Development
## 3.1 Construct a Python script that uses a Cisco SDK given SDK documentation
### What is an SDK?
Colection of:
* libraries, 
* APIs, 
* documentation,
* tools, 
* sample code, 
* processes     
for a specific language, with the purpose of making it easier and faster for developers to work with a particular product.

Source for Cisco SDK's: https://developer.cisco.com

## 3.2 Describe the capabilities of Cisco network management platforms and APIs (Meraki, Cisco DNA Center, ACI, Cisco SD-WAN, and NSO)
### Meraki
https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/    
SDKs (all use the Dashboard API):
* Python library python-meraki
    * pip install meraki
    * can simulate POST/PUT/DELETE to preview frist
    * pagination, retries
* Node.js SDK - deprecated March 2020
* Ruby SDK - deprecated March 2020

Multiple APIs:
* Meraki Dashboard API
    * Base endpoint URL : https://api.meraki.com/api/v0
    * you can make direct HTTP requests to dashboard API in any programming language or REST API client
    * v0 is mainly in use. v1 is in beta
    * uses API_KEY for authentication. to be supplied in every request header as "X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key"
    * 'Accept: application/json'
    * requires an Organization ID and sometimes Network ID to be specified
    * requires API access to be enabled in the web dashboard
    *

    * RESTful
    * JSON
    * Authentication Domain
        * Token required for REST calls

    * Using CLI, SNMP or Netconf
* Events and Notifications (Eastbound)
    * Notifications triggered by DNAC events
    * Note: I don't really understand the difference between this API and the Event Management module of the Intent Management API
* Integration API (Westbound)
    * Integration with 3rd party IT Service Management platforms
    * Service Desk, Change Management, Reporting, etc.

* DNAC supports webhooks
* Header for token authentication = 'X-Auth-Token'
    * Token is received after completing Basic Auth

* DNAC APIs are rate limited to 5 requests per minute

#### SDKs
* Python SDK
    * pip install dnacentersdk
```
from dnacentersdk import api

# Create a DNACenterAPI connection object;
# it uses DNA Center sandbox URL, username and
password

DNAC = api.DNACenterAPI(username="devnetuser", password="Cisco123!", base_url="https://sandboxdnac2.cisco.com")

# Find all devices
DEVICES = DNAC.devices.get_device_list()
```

### ACI
https://developer.cisco.com/site/aci/    
#### About ACI
* The Nexus 9000 has two modes of operation to fit different operational models: NX-OS mode and Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode.
* ACI Mode uses a cluster of 3 controllers (APICs)
    * Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers
* ACI Mode provides spine/leaf architecture 
    * APICs connect to leaf switches
* ACI Mode switches are **only** programmable via the policy engine on the APIC.
    * Configuration is held as XML or JSON on the controller
    * Each switch also holds a copy of the Concrete model
    * "Desired state network" aka "Model driven framework"
* ACI Tenants
    * separate network/failure domains
    * divided into Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy
    * Tenant Networking
        * L2 and L3 connectivity, VRFs, bridge domains, subnets, etc.
    * Tenant Policy
        * Application profiles, end point groups, contracts, filters
        * Examples: Allow webservers in EPG (end point group) Delta to connect to SQL DB servers and apply specific QoS

#### MIM Managemnent Information Model
* MIM is represented in a tree, the MIT
* Nodes in the tree are any physical or logical Management Object, the MO
* MOs use Distinguished Name naming convention 
* Tenants are top-level MOs
#### RESt Interface
* Northbound: REST API, CLI and GUI for operators and developers
* Southbound: OpFlex protocol for managing the Nexus switches
* APIC is designed from day one around APIs
* https://APIC_Host:port/api/{mo|class}/{dn|clas
sname}.{xml|json}?\[options]
    * Content-Type headers are ignored
* Authentication is done via the generic endpoint above, against the aaaLogin.js which returns a Token
    * Token is then supplied in subsequent requests as a cookie (APIC-cookie)
#### APIC SDKs
* Python SDK: **Cobra**
* Python library: **acitoolkit**/ **pyaci**
* Ruby: **ACIrb**
* Puppet and Ansible extensively supported

    * first point of authentication for all the fabric components
    * distributes the list of vSmart and vManage components to the vEdge routers
    * facilitates NAT traversal
    * requires universally reachable (public) IP address by all the fabric components.
    * single and multi-tenant

* vEdge
    * vManage, vSmart, and vBond are virtual and can run in both VMware ESXi and KVM virtualization environments
    * vEdges are the routers that get deployed at all the sites throughout the fabric.
    * establish secure control plane connections with the vSmart controllers
    * proprietary Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) 
    * enforce the desired data plane policies
